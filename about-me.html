<h1>About Me!</h1>

<div class="margin_borders"> 

<p>Hello, my name is Isaiah Catubig. I am from San Francisco, California and I am fifteen years old. I am proud to be of mixed race and to be part of SMASH Stanford. I enjoy exploring new places and trying new things.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is be around my family. My family always motivates and pushes me to do my personal best both in and outside of school. I look forward to seeing them next month when I come back home. </p>
